        <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
        <P> The goal of this project is to enhance the travel planning experience for Delta Air Lines' frequent flyers
            by creating an interactive visualization of international flights operated by Delta in October. The motivation
            is to provide a user-friendly tool for members to efficiently redeem their points and select the most convenient
            flights based on location, time, and other specific preferences.
        </P>

        <h2>Related Work</h2>
        <img src="img/flightrader.png" alt="flightradar24 website">
        <P> This project is inspired by various flight visualization tools and heat maps that showcase global flight
            patterns. Resources such as the 'FlightRadar24' website and academic papers on GIS (Geographic Information
            System) applications in aviation have informed our approach. Discussions in class about interactive data
            visualization have also played a pivotal role in shaping our design.
        </P>

    <section id="part3">
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <h4>1. Where do international Delta flights depart from and arrive at?</h4>
        <h4>2. What are the specific dates, times, and frequencies of these flights?</h4>
        <h4>3. Which direct international routes are available?</h4>
        <P> Throughout the project, these questions evolved to consider the user experience and the visual
            representation of data. New questions included how to make the visualization more interactive and
            informative, such as incorporating a search function or showing flight details on hover.
        </P>
    </section>

    <section id="part4">
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <P> The data was sourced from Delta Air Lines' international flight schedule, available at Delta's official
            website. The initial dataset was in an Excel format, which was cleaned and processed to enhance readability
            and utility.
        </P>
    </section>

    <section id="part5">
        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis:</h2>
        <P> Initial visualizations included basic maps with plotted routes. Insights from these early visualizations
            indicated the need for a more interactive approach, leading to the adoption of GeoJSON for more sophisticated
            geographic representations.
        </P>

    <section id="part6">
        <h2>Design Evolution:</h2>
        <h4>1. A global map highlighting routes between the selected country and America.</h4>
        <img src="img/heatmap_exg.png" alt="flight heat map">
        <h4>2. A design showing all routes from a chosen departure city.</h4>
        <h4>3. A searchable map allowing users to input departure and arrival cities to display corresponding routes.</h4>
        <img src="img/searchengine.png" alt="search engine">
        <P> The final design chosen was the third option, providing a balance between interactivity and information
            clarity.
        </P>
    </section>

    <section id="part7">
        <h2>Implementation:</h2>
        <img src="img/currentstate.png" alt="current progress">
        <P> The interactive visualizations are grounded on a GeoJSON-powered global map, with search functionality allowing
            users to discover direct flight routes by entering departure and arrival cities. The map provides a
            comprehensive view of Delta's international routes, aiding travelers in efficient trip planning.
        </P>
    </section>

    <section id="part8">
        <h2>Evaluation:</h2>
        <P> The visualizations revealed patterns and insights such as key hubs for Delta and the most frequent international
            routes. The effectiveness of the visualization was confirmed through user engagement, and future improvements
            could include adding real-time flight status updates or incorporating user feedback mechanisms.
        </P>
        <P> In addressing these points, you'll want to elaborate on each section based on the details of your project and
            ensure you include images and references to the visualizations you've created, which can effectively support
            your descriptions of the design and implementation.
